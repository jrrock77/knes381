<p style="color:Violet;">Here is some extra text just to make sure you know where to find things. First, the hyperlink on the left of the page sends you to a file with some average data found on the internet. That file is stored in a folder within my repository called subfolder. The picture on the right is an image found on google downloaded to my computer and then pushed to my repository on GitHub. It is also stored in the folder named subfolder.</p>
<p style="color:OrangeRed;">GitHub struggles to demonstrate all of this code properly. To view the image, see the preview on this link. To view the proper format for the link including the requirment for the special character and subscript in V02, as well as the colored text, you can open in a Word Doc.</p>
